fabl-js
=======

Porting to Javascript of the [Fabl](https://s3.amazonaws.com/s3.fabl.net/index.html) programming language by Chris Goad.

This porting reuses most of the code written in Fabl in the [original implementation](https://github.com/chrisGoad/fabl),
which targets a Fabl virtual machine written in C.

For the moment the C source code is kept in this project too for reference, later it will be removed.
